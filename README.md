# CNN-Project-Dog-Breed-Classifier
Project Overview
Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! this project is a part of my UDACITY ND programme.
What I've learnt:
how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, making important design decisions about the user experience for app. 

It took me about 25-30days to finish and I continuously worked on it around the clock!!So All praises to Allah to help me finishing this..Alhamdulillah.

Thanks to AbdalMalek and Diana B to help me on this and also thanks a lot to the mentors for answering my questions in Knowledge section.
Also  those who helped from stackOverflow and @ptr_blk from torch_discussion_forum
